# Packaging Status (0.0.1 alpha)

This repository includes directories for various package managers (`Formula/`, `macports/`, `aur/`, `nix/`, `conda/`, `scoop/`, `snap/`, `chocolatey/`, `winget/`). They exist as templates only.

- Checksums and download URLs are placeholders.
- The 0.0.1 release does not ship pre-built binaries for these ecosystems.
- Do not publish these manifests without filling in the correct artifacts and verifying the installation workflow.

Once releases are ready for a specific ecosystem we will update the relevant directory and note it in `docs/STATUS.md`.
