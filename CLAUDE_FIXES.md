## Critical Issues

### 1. ‚úÖ FIXED - Durability Gap in `NamespaceManager`
- **Summary:** Namespace-level mutations are never persisted. `NamespaceManager::upsert` and `NamespaceManager::remove` mutate the in-memory `VecStore`, yet no call to `VecStore::save()` (or equivalent) follows the mutation (`src/namespace_manager.rs:218`, `src/namespace_manager.rs:290`).
- **Impact:** Any crash, process restart, or call to `backup_namespace` (which reopens the store from disk) silently discards recent writes. Users perceive ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù upserts/deletes that vanish later. Backups also become inconsistent because they omit unpublished changes.
- **How to Reproduce:**
  1. Create a namespace, call `manager.upsert(...)` to insert a vector.
  2. Exit the process without manually calling `VecStore::save`.
  3. Restart and load the namespace, or trigger `backup_namespace` immediately. The inserted vector is missing. (`tests/review_regressions.rs::namespace_manager_should_persist_upserts_without_manual_save` now codifies this.)
- **Root Cause:** Durability is left to callers, but the public API never exposes that requirement. `NamespaceManager` assumes in-memory state is authoritative while durability helpers (`save`, snapshots) re-open from disk state.
- **Fix Ideas:**
  - Option A: Invoke `store.save()` after every mutating operation. Optimize with dirty flags or batched commits if throughput is a concern.
  - Option B: Introduce an explicit transaction/commit API on the manager and require callers to opt in before operations, with documentation and guardrails.
  - Option C: Move persistence responsibility into a background worker that flushes deltas at a configurable cadence.
- **Suggested Regression Tests:**
  - Keep the new failing test and make it pass once the persistence fix lands.
  - Add a scenario covering `backup_namespace` ‚Üí restore path.

### 2. ‚úÖ FIXED - Incorrect HNSW Index Serialization (`next_idx`)
- **Summary:** `VecStore::save` and `VecStore::create_snapshot` serialize the HNSW `next_idx` counter as `self.backend.get_id_to_idx_map().len()` instead of the backend‚Äôs real `next_idx` (`src/store/mod.rs:488`, `src/store/mod.rs:584`). When deletions have occurred, the counter is larger than the map length. After reload, the restored backend reuses an existing internal index, corrupting the ID ‚Üí vector mapping.
- **Impact:**
  - Silent data corruption: after deleting vectors, saving, and reloading, subsequent inserts can overwrite unrelated vectors due to ID collisions inside hnsw_rs.
  - Snapshots become unreliable, because restored stores have inconsistent graph structure.
- **How to Reproduce:**
  1. Insert ‚â•2 vectors.
  2. Delete one via `remove`.
  3. Call `save()`, reopen the store, insert a new vector, and issue a query. The new vector returns results under the wrong ID, or the query panics due to missing entries. (A reproduction harness can be added after the fix; see ‚ÄúFollow-Ups‚Äù.)
- **Root Cause:** The serialization path lacks a way to read `next_idx` from `HnswBackend`; the length of the ID mapping is not equivalent once deletions happen.
- **Fix Ideas:**
  - Expose `HnswBackend::next_idx()` and `set_next_idx()` so the store can write/read the true counter.
  - Alternatively, persist the sequence of insert/remove operations or rebuild the counter as `max(idx_to_id.keys()) + 1` instead of `len()`.
- **Suggested Regression Tests:**
  - Add an integration test that deletes a record, saves, reloads, inserts a new record, and verifies query results remain consistent.
  - Extend snapshot tests to verify round-tripping of `next_idx` after deletions.

## Major Issues

### 3. ‚úÖ FIXED - BM25 Statistics Drift on Re-Index
- **Summary:** `TextIndex::index_document` removes previous postings for a document but still increments `self.num_docs += 1` unconditionally (`src/store/hybrid.rs:112‚Äì145`). Re-indexing a document for updates counts it as an additional document, inflating `num_docs`, altering IDF weights, and skewing average document length.
- **Impact:** Hybrid search quality degrades over time because BM25 starts to believe there are more documents than actually exist, reducing the importance of rare terms and misranking results.
- **How to Reproduce:**
  1. Index a document, compute BM25 score.
  2. Re-index the same doc, compute again; score collapses because `num_docs` doubled. (`tests/review_regressions.rs::text_index_reindex_should_not_drift_bm25_scores` demonstrates this.)
- **Root Cause:** The removal path subtracts postings but never decrements `num_docs`. Average length is recomputed, but `num_docs` stays inflated.
- **Fix Ideas:**
  - Before incrementing `num_docs`, detect whether the document already existed. If so, leave `num_docs` unchanged.
  - Optionally track `num_docs` as `texts.len()` rather than manually incrementing.
- **Suggested Regression Tests:**
  - Keep the new failing test and ensure it passes once fixed.
  - Cover hybrid query accuracy by asserting rankings remain identical after re-indexing a document.

### 4. ‚úÖ FIXED - Dangling Keyword Postings After Deletes
- **Summary:** Hard deletes (`VecStore::remove`, `VecStore::compact`) purge vector records but never notify the text index (`src/store/mod.rs:210`, `src/store/mod.rs:906`). As a result, the inverted index retains postings for documents that no longer exist.
- **Impact:**
  - Hybrid search returns results whose vectors were deleted; vector lookup then fails or returns stale metadata.
  - Keyword-only searches leak deleted content to users, violating expectations and increasing risk of PII retention.
- **How to Reproduce:**
  1. Upsert + `index_text` a record.
  2. Call `remove`.
  3. `VecStore::has_text` still returns `true` (`tests/review_regressions.rs::removing_records_should_drop_text_index_state`).
- **Root Cause:** No integration between vector deletion lifecycle and `TextIndex` maintenance. The index only shrinks when `TextIndex::remove_document` is called manually.
- **Fix Ideas:**
  - Call `self.text_index.remove_document(id)` inside `remove`, `compact`, and TTL-expiration paths.
  - Consider centralizing record lifecycle management so the text index and vector index stay in sync.
- **Suggested Regression Tests:**
  - Keep the new failing test.
  - Extend hybrid query tests to delete/compact documents and assert that results disappear from both vector and keyword modes.

### 5. ‚úÖ FIXED - Distance Configuration Ignored
- **Summary:** The public API exposes `Config::distance`, but the backend was hard-wired to cosine similarity (`src/store/hnsw_backend.rs:8,17,22`). Query explanations also labeled every result as "Cosine" (`src/store/mod.rs:382`). No code path switched the distance metric or adjusted scoring.
- **Impact:** Users believed they were selecting L2/Manhattan/etc., but the store actually executed cosine similarity. This was a silent semantic bug leading to incorrect rankings and potentially incorrect business decisions.
- **How to Reproduce (before fix):**
  1. Build a store with `.distance(Distance::Euclidean)`.
  2. Run `query_explain`; explanation still says "Cosine" (`tests/review_regressions.rs::query_explain_should_report_configured_distance_metric`).
- **Root Cause:** `VecStore::open_with_config` accepted a `Config`, but never passed the distance choice into the backend. `HnswBackend::new` always instantiated `DistCosine`, and scoring converted distances as if cosine were used.
- **Fix Applied (2025-10-20):**
  - Refactored `HnswBackend` to use enum-based polymorphism with `HnswInstance` enum (`src/store/hnsw_backend.rs:8-12`)
  - Updated `HnswBackend::new()` to accept `Distance` parameter and instantiate correct HNSW type (`src/store/hnsw_backend.rs:24-57`)
  - Updated `HnswBackend::restore()` to accept and use configured distance metric (`src/store/hnsw_backend.rs:151-186`)
  - Pass configured distance from `VecStore` to backend at all call sites (`src/store/mod.rs:151,182,218,291,1454`)
  - Fixed query explanations to report actual configured distance metric (`src/store/mod.rs:453`)
  - Proper score inversion for Euclidean distance (`src/store/hnsw_backend.rs:117-120,251-253`)
  - Clear error messages for unsupported distance metrics (`src/store/hnsw_backend.rs:39-46,168-175`)
  - Updated tests to verify unsupported metrics return errors (`src/store/mod.rs:2235-2274`)
- **Supported Distance Metrics:**
  - ‚úÖ Cosine (default)
  - ‚úÖ Euclidean (with proper score inversion)
  - ‚úÖ DotProduct
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Manhattan, Hamming, Jaccard, Chebyshev, Canberra, BrayCurtis (return clear error message)
- **Testing:** All 670 tests passing. Unsupported distance metrics now return helpful error messages pointing to future support.

### 6. Hybrid Text Index Not Persisted Across Restarts ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Summary:** `VecStore::open` never reloaded the keyword index. On reopen the store built a fresh `TextIndex`, so previously indexed documents lost their text (`src/store/mod.rs:90`, `src/store/mod.rs:617`).
- **Impact:** Hybrid and keyword-only search silently degraded after any restart or snapshot restore‚Äîdocuments were still queryable by vector ID, but keyword lookups returned nothing.
- **Fix Applied:**
  - Incremented schema version to 3 (`src/store/disk.rs:8`)
  - Added `text_index_path()` and text index parameter to `save_all()` (`src/store/disk.rs:66-88`)
  - Added text index loading in `load_all()` with backward compatibility (`src/store/disk.rs:164-177`)
  - Added `export_texts()` and `import_texts()` methods to TextIndex (`src/store/hybrid.rs:350-377`)
  - Updated `VecStore::save()` to persist text index (`src/store/mod.rs:530-545`)
  - Updated `VecStore::open_with_config()` to restore text index (`src/store/mod.rs:154-158`)
  - Updated `VecStore::create_snapshot()` to include text index (`src/store/mod.rs:635-650`)
  - Updated `VecStore::restore_snapshot()` to restore text index (`src/store/mod.rs:763-767`)
- **Test Coverage:** Added 4 comprehensive tests in `src/store/mod.rs:2307-2419`:
  - `test_text_index_persists_across_reopen` - verifies text survives store reopen
  - `test_text_index_persists_in_snapshots` - verifies text survives snapshot restore
  - `test_text_index_empty_on_new_store` - verifies clean state for new stores
  - `test_multiple_texts_persist` - verifies bulk text persistence
- **Status:** Text index now fully persists across restarts and snapshots. Schema v3 is backward compatible with v1 and v2.

### 7. ‚úÖ FIXED - Store Configuration Not Persisted
- **Summary:** Custom builder settings (distance metric, `hnsw_m`, `hnsw_ef_construction`) are held in-memory only. Reopening with `VecStore::open` silently reverts to defaults (`src/store/mod.rs:72`, `src/store/mod.rs:488`).
- **Impact:** Deployments that tune HNSW parameters or distance metrics lose their configuration after restart, causing inconsistent search quality and making config management error-prone.
- **How to Reproduce:**
  1. Build a store with non-default settings.
  2. Drop it, reopen via `VecStore::open`.
  3. Inspect `config()`/`distance_metric()`‚Äîvalues reset (`tests/review_regressions.rs::store_configuration_should_persist_across_reopen`).
- **Root Cause:** The disk layout and manifest never record configuration, and `open()` does not accept caller-supplied settings.
- **Fix Ideas:**
  - Persist the builder configuration in `manifest.json` and reload it on open.
  - Alternatively, require callers to reopen via `VecStore::builder(...).build()` and document that `VecStore::open()` always uses defaults.
- **Suggested Regression Tests:**
  - Keep the new failing test.
  - Add coverage ensuring saved configuration round-trips through snapshots as well.

### 8. ‚úÖ FIXED - Query With Custom HNSW Params Returns Too Few Results
- **Summary:** `VecStore::query_with_params` caps the search `k` to `params.ef_search` whenever no filter is supplied (`src/store/mod.rs:1514`). If a caller requests more results than `ef_search`, the backend returns only `ef_search` neighbors, even though `k` is higher.
- **Impact:** Applications that tune `ef_search` for speed unknowingly receive fewer results than requested. This silently breaks pagination and relevance tuning because the API contract (‚Äúreturn up to `k` neighbors‚Äù) is violated.
- **How to Reproduce:** `tests/review_regressions.rs::query_with_params_should_return_requested_k` loads 10 vectors, asks for `k = 5` but receives only 3 results when `ef_search = 3`.
- **Root Cause:** The implementation reuses `ef_search` as both the candidate list size and the requested `k` handed to `search_with_ef`, instead of ensuring the search collects at least `k` neighbors.
- **Fix Ideas:** Always request at least `k` neighbors from the backend (e.g., `max(k, ef_search)`) while keeping the dynamic candidate list governed by `ef_search`. Alternatively, surface an explicit warning or error when callers supply inconsistent parameters.
- **Suggested Regression Tests:** Keep the new failing test and add variants that exercise filtered queries to ensure the fix covers both branches.

### 9. ‚úÖ FIXED - Filter Parser Does Not Recognize `IN` / `NOT IN`
- **Summary:** The lexer never emits tokens for `IN`/`NOT IN`, nor does the parser handle them (`src/store/filter_parser.rs:257`). Yet `FilterOp` supports these operators and the evaluator implements them (`src/store/filters.rs:19`).
- **Impact:** Any filter string using `IN` or `NOT IN` fails to parse, so advertised SQL-like syntax is unusable. This breaks hybrid queries relying on taxonomy filters.
- **How to Reproduce:** `tests/review_regressions.rs::filter_parser_should_support_in_operator` calls `parse_filter("status IN ['active']")`, which returns an error instead of a parsed AST.
- **Root Cause:** Tokenization only treats alphabetic identifiers as field names/keywords but never matches the `IN` keyword, and the comparison parser only accepts the existing operator enum subset.
- **Fix Ideas:** Extend the lexer to produce dedicated `Token::In`/`Token::NotIn` variants (handling the two-word sequence) and map them to `FilterOp::In` / `FilterOp::NotIn`. Update error messages accordingly.
- **Suggested Regression Tests:** Keep the new failing test and add coverage for `NOT IN` with numeric and string arrays once implemented.

### 10. ‚úÖ FIXED - Large `k` Causes Integer Overflow in Fetch Size Calculation
- **Summary:** Both `query` and `hybrid_query` compute `fetch_size` using `k * 10` (or `k * 2`) without checked arithmetic (`src/store/mod.rs:292`, `src/store/mod.rs:714`). Supplying a very large `k` (e.g., `usize::MAX / 2`) overflows in debug builds, causing a panic before any search occurs.
- **Impact:** High-`k` queries crash the process instead of returning an error, breaking callers that rely on dynamic limits (e.g., ‚Äúfetch everything‚Äù) or that pass user-provided `k` values without bounds.
- **How to Reproduce:** `tests/review_regressions.rs::query_with_large_k_should_not_overflow_fetch_size` attempts such a query and observes the panic through `catch_unwind`.
- **Root Cause:** Plain integer multiplication on `usize` is unchecked in release (wraps) and panics in debug. The code multiplies before applying `min`, so the overflow happens even when the store contains only a handful of records.
- **Fix Ideas:** Compute fetch sizes with `saturating_mul`, `checked_mul` + fallback to `usize::MAX`, or restructure the logic to cap by record count before multiplying. Apply the same fix to `hybrid_query`, `query_explain`, and any other spot using `k * N`.
- **Suggested Regression Tests:** Keep the new failing test and add analogous coverage for `hybrid_query` once fixed.

### 11. ‚úÖ FIXED - `explain_query` Emits NaN/Inf When Store Is Empty
- **Summary:** Query planning divides by `ln(total_records)` when estimating HNSW cost (`src/store/mod.rs:1677`). When the store has zero or one record, the logarithm becomes `-inf` or `0`, causing NaNs in the estimated cost and per-step metrics.
- **Impact:** Observability features surface ‚ÄúNaN‚Äù/‚Äúinf‚Äù values, breaking dashboards and making explain output unusable for empty or tiny collections‚Äîa common case during initial bootstrapping.
- **How to Reproduce:** `tests/review_regressions.rs::explain_query_should_not_emit_nan_for_empty_store` opens a fresh store and calls `explain_query`, observing non-finite costs.
- **Root Cause:** The estimator assumes `total_records > 1` before taking logarithms. No guard exists for empty stores, so the floating-point arithmetic propagates infinities.
- **Fix Ideas:** Short-circuit when `total_records < 2`, returning zero cost and adding a recommendation to ingest data. Alternatively, clamp denominators to a minimum (e.g., `ln(max(total_records, 2))`).
- **Suggested Regression Tests:** Keep the new failing test and add coverage for the single-record case, plus hybrid explain paths if implemented separately.

### 12. ‚úÖ FIXED - Hybrid Search Returns Soft-Deleted Records
- **Summary:** `VecStore::hybrid_query` never filters out soft-deleted documents; it simply looks up metadata and copies it into the result (`src/store/mod.rs:720`). Soft deletes flip the record‚Äôs `deleted` flag, but hybrid results ignore it.
- **Impact:** Users issuing hybrid (vector + keyword) searches see documents they deleted or whose TTL expired. This violates data deletion guarantees and leaks content that other query paths correctly hide.
- **How to Reproduce:** `tests/review_regressions.rs::hybrid_query_should_skip_soft_deleted_records` soft-deletes a document and still receives it from `hybrid_query`.
- **Root Cause:** Unlike `query` and `query_explain`, `hybrid_query` never checks `record.deleted` before pushing a neighbor.
- **Fix Ideas:** Mirror the guard used in `query`: skip results where `record.deleted` is true, and consider purging text index state during soft delete as part of the same fix.
- **Suggested Regression Tests:** Keep the new failing test and add a companion for TTL expirations once `expire_ttl_records` is wired into hybrid search.

### 13. ‚úÖ FIXED - Filter Parser Missing `STARTSWITH` Despite Example Usage
- **Summary:** Examples such as `examples/openai_rag.rs` use SQL syntax `doc_id STARTSWITH 'rust_'`, but the parser cannot recognize the operator (`src/store/filter_parser.rs`). It treats `STARTSWITH` as an identifier, triggering an ‚Äúexpected operator‚Äù error.
- **Impact:** Copy-pasting example code fails at runtime; users cannot execute prefix queries via the documented DSL, forcing them back to manual `FilterExpr` construction.
- **How to Reproduce:** `tests/review_regressions.rs::filter_parser_should_support_startswith_operator` attempts to parse the example filter and receives an error.
- **Root Cause:** The lexer only recognizes `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and `CONTAINS` keywords; `STARTSWITH`/`ENDSWITH`/`HAS_PREFIX` etc. are absent, and there is no `FilterOp` variant wired for prefix matching.
- **Fix Ideas:** Extend `FilterOp` (or reuse `Contains`) to include prefix/suffix operations and update the lexer/parser accordingly. Alternatively, remove the operator from examples until implemented.
- **Suggested Regression Tests:** Keep the new failing test and add coverage for any other advertised operators once they‚Äôre supported.

### 14. ‚úÖ FIXED - `query_with_params` Accepts Invalid `ef_search`
- **Summary:** The per-query tuning API allows `HNSWSearchParams { ef_search: 0 }`, which leads to zero candidates fetched (`src/store/mod.rs:1589`). There‚Äôs no validation or fallback, so callers accidentally pass `0` (or any value < 1) and receive empty results even when matches exist.
- **Impact:** User code that derives `ef_search` dynamically (e.g., from sliders or configs) can silently break discovery: the store returns no neighbors without any error, making the issue difficult to diagnose.
- **How to Reproduce:** `tests/review_regressions.rs::query_with_params_should_reject_zero_ef_search` inserts one vector and queries with `ef_search = 0`; the query returns an empty set.
- **Root Cause:** `query_with_params` uses `std::cmp::min(params.ef_search, self.records.len())` without enforcing a lower bound. Because `HNSWSearchParams` is a plain struct, callers can construct invalid values (0, 1, etc.), despite docs stating the range is 10‚Äì500.
- **Fix Ideas:** Validate inputs‚Äîeither guard in `query_with_params` (clamp to at least 1 or a documented minimum) or enforce invariants via `HNSWSearchParams::new` constructors. Returning an `Err` for invalid values is preferable to silently producing empty results.
- **Suggested Regression Tests:** Keep the new failing test and add coverage for other edge cases (e.g., extremely large `ef_search`) after clamping logic is implemented.

### 15. ‚úÖ FIXED - `explain_query` Succeeds With Empty Query Vector
- **Summary:** Before checking vector dimensions, `explain_query` relies on the existing `Query::new(vec![])` builder, which returns an empty vector even though the store has a non-zero dimension. The subsequent length check is bypassed because the dimension is still zero, so the call proceeds, producing nonsensical output instead of an error.
- **Impact:** Callers can accidentally (or due to bugs) pass empty vectors and receive misleading plans with zero-cost steps, hiding real configuration issues.
- **How to Reproduce:** `tests/review_regressions.rs::explain_query_should_fail_gracefully_when_vector_missing` uses an empty vector and expects an error, but the current implementation succeeds.
- **Root Cause:** `Query::new` permits any vector, including empty, and `explain_query` only rejects dimension mismatches once the store has been populated. When the store is empty, the guard never fires.
- **Fix Ideas:** Validate input vectors up front‚Äîeither reject empty vectors in `Query::new` or explicitly check in `explain_query` and `query` before proceeding.
- **Suggested Regression Tests:** Keep the new failing test and add coverage for single-element vectors vs. higher-dimensional stores once validation is added.

### 16. ‚úÖ FIXED - `prefetch_query` Allows Invalid Stage Sequences
- **Summary:** The multi-stage prefetch API accepts `Rerank`, `MMR`, or `Filter` as the first stage because it only checks whether the intermediate candidate list is empty (`src/store/mod.rs:1436`). If the initial stage is rerank (with empty candidates), the error message is confusing (‚Äúrequires previous stage results‚Äù) instead of rejecting the configuration up front.
- **Impact:** APIs/examples suggest stage ordering semantics, but callers can accidentally construct impossible plans and receive runtime errors. This complicates debugging and violates the ergonomic goal of the prefetch builder.
- **How to Reproduce:** `tests/review_regressions.rs::prefetch_query_should_validate_stage_order` creates a single-stage `PrefetchQuery` containing `QueryStage::Rerank`. The current implementation returns an error about missing previous results; the API should reject such plans early with a clearer message.
- **Root Cause:** There is no validation step ensuring the first stage is a search stage (`VectorSearch` or `HybridSearch`).
- **Fix Ideas:** Add validation before executing stages‚Äîcheck that the first stage is `VectorSearch`/`HybridSearch`, and optionally confirm that subsequent stages only appear after a search stage.
- **Suggested Regression Tests:** Keep the new failing test and add a positive case ensuring valid sequences continue to work.

### 17. ‚úÖ FIXED - `Query::with_filter` Silently Ignores Parse Errors
- **Summary:** The builder helper swallows parsing failures and returns the original query unchanged (`src/store/types.rs:191`). Docs/examples encourage `.with_filter("role IN ['admin']")`, but since `IN` isn't recognized, the filter is dropped silently.
- **Impact:** Callers believe filters are applied, yet queries execute without them, potentially leaking data across tenants or returning confidential rows. Debugging is difficult because no error is surfaced.
- **How to Reproduce:** `tests/review_regressions.rs::query_with_filter_should_not_silently_ignore_parse_errors` builds such a query; the store returns both admin and user records instead of only admin.
- **Root Cause:** The helper catches `parse_filter` errors and returns `self` without filter to keep the builder chain ergonomic.
- **Fix Ideas:** Change the API to return `Result<Self>` or store the error for later inspection. At minimum, log/record the parse failure and provide a strict alternative (`try_with_filter`).
- **Suggested Regression Tests:** Keep the new failing test and add unit coverage once a strict builder is implemented.

### 18. ‚úÖ FIXED - Suspended Namespaces Still Accept Queries
- **Summary:** `Namespace::can_query` only blocks namespaces in `PendingDeletion` status (`src/namespace.rs:120`). `NamespaceManager::query` calls it before serving queries. Namespaces marked `Suspended` continue to accept reads, despite documentation implying they should be disabled.
- **Impact:** SaaS operators cannot enforce suspensions‚Äîcustomers marked suspended still issue queries and consume resources.
- **How to Reproduce:** `tests/review_regressions.rs::namespace_manager_should_block_queries_when_suspended` creates a namespace, suspends it, and observes `query` succeeding.
- **Root Cause:** Status check is incomplete; suspended/read-only namespaces are not gated.
- **Fix Ideas:** Update `Namespace::can_query` (and `can_upsert`) to honor all restrictive statuses (`Suspended`, `ReadOnly`, etc.) and return meaningful errors.
- **Suggested Regression Tests:** Keep the new failing test and add coverage for read-only namespaces once implemented.

### 19. ‚úÖ FIXED - Distributed Store Allows Zero-Shard Configuration
- **Summary:** `DistributedConfig::with_num_shards(0)` is accepted (`src/distributed.rs:360`), and `DistributedStore::create` happily constructs the store. When `get_shard_id` is later invoked, it performs modulo by `num_shards`, leading to a panic (`src/distributed.rs:404`).
- **Impact:** Invalid configuration yields crashes instead of early validation. Operators can accidentally deploy with zero shards and hit panics under load.
- **How to Reproduce:** `tests/review_regressions.rs::distributed_config_zero_shards_panics` creates such a store and observes a panic via `catch_unwind`.
- **Root Cause:** No validation on configuration inputs (num_shards, replication factor, etc.).
- **Fix Ideas:** Reject zero (or otherwise invalid) shard counts in `DistributedConfig::with_num_shards`/`create`, returning an error instead of allowing a later panic.
- **Suggested Regression Tests:** Keep the new failing test and add validation for replication factor vs. nodes once clamping logic is added.

### 20. ‚úÖ FIXED - VecStore Allows Zero-Dimension Vectors
- **Summary:** `VecStore::upsert` sets the store dimension from the first insert. If callers insert an empty vector, the store dimension becomes zero, and subsequent operations either fail unexpectedly or corrupt assumptions (`src/store/mod.rs:174`).
- **Impact:** A single bad write poisons the collection‚Äîfuture queries with real embeddings will error (‚Äúdimension mismatch‚Äù), snapshots contain zero-dimension vectors, and the indexing backend is effectively unusable.
- **How to Reproduce:** `tests/review_regressions.rs::vecstore_should_reject_zero_length_vectors` upserts an empty vector; the operation succeeds instead of returning an error.
- **Root Cause:** No validation ensures vectors are non-empty before setting the store dimension.
- **Fix Ideas:** Reject zero-length vectors in `upsert`, `batch_upsert`, and related APIs (including TTL variants) before touching backend state.
- **Suggested Regression Tests:** Keep the new failing test and extend coverage for `batch_upsert` once validation is added.

### 21. ‚úÖ FIXED - VecStore Accepts Mixed Vector Dimensions
- **Summary:** After the first insert sets the collection dimension, subsequent inserts with different lengths should be rejected. However, `upsert` only updates dimension when it is zero; mixed-dimension vectors silently corrupt the backend (`src/store/mod.rs:171`).
- **Impact:** Misconfigured clients can insert shorter vectors, leading to panics or incorrect similarity calculations when the backend tries to index inconsistent data.
- **How to Reproduce:** `tests/review_regressions.rs::vecstore_should_require_minimum_dimension` first inserts a 3-D vector, then a 2-D vector. The bug allows the second insert instead of returning an error.
- **Root Cause:** Dimension mismatch check is missing before calling backend insert.
- **Fix Ideas:** Compare vector length to `self.dimension` and return an error before touching backend state. Apply same guard to batch APIs.
- **Suggested Regression Tests:** Keep the new failing test and add batch coverage after fixing.

### 22. ‚úÖ FIXED - Graph Visualizer Claims Support but Returns Error
- **Summary:** The native `VecStore::visualizer` path always returns an error because graph visualization is only supported in WASM builds (`src/store/hnsw_backend.rs:233`). However, the API is exposed without feature gating, and examples imply universal availability, leading to runtime surprises.
- **Impact:** Users encounter a confusing error after building the store, thinking graph visualization is available on native targets.
- **How to Reproduce:** `tests/review_regressions.rs::graph_visualizer_native_backend_should_error` invokes `visualizer` on a native backend and expects an error.
- **Root Cause:** Lack of feature-detection or clear error messaging in the native backend‚Äôs `to_visualizer` implementation.
- **Fix Ideas:** Either hide the API behind a `wasm32` feature or return a descriptive error encouraging users to switch targets.
- **Suggested Regression Tests:** Keep the new failing test and ensure WASM builds still succeed once messaging is improved.

### 23. ‚úÖ FIXED - `TextIndex::update_avg_doc_length` Recomputes Global Sum Each Insert
- **Summary (Optimization):** Every call to `TextIndex::index_document` recomputes average document length by summing all doc lengths (`src/store/hybrid.rs:116`). This makes indexing O(n) per document instead of O(1).
- **Impact:** Large corpora (hundreds of thousands of docs) incur quadratic time during ingestion, slowing hybrid search ingestion paths and examples that rely on `index_text`.
- **Optimization Idea:** Track cumulative length and document count as incremental counters, updating averages in O(1). Alternatively, store running totals and only recalc on deletions.
- **Suggested Tests/Benchmarks:** Augment benchmarks or add a stress test that indexes 10k docs and asserts time stays linear after optimization.

### 24. `VecStore::query`/`hybrid_query` Over-fetch Heuristics Are Fixed
- **Summary (Optimization):** Fetch size is hard-coded to `k` (no filter) or `k * 10` (with filter) (`src/store/mod.rs:320`, `src/store/mod.rs:707`). For large `k` or sparse filters, this performs excessive distance calculations or too few (if selectivity is high).
- **Impact:** Users cannot tune recall/latency trade-offs without forking the crate; production workloads pay unnecessary CPU costs.
- **Optimization Idea:** Expose fetch/overfetch multipliers (or target recall) in `Query`/`Config`, defaulting to current behavior. Consider adaptive heuristics based on previous selectivity metrics.
- **Suggested Tests/Benchmarks:** Add microbenchmarks covering high/low selectivity queries with configurable factors; ensure defaults match existing expectations.

### 25. TTL Expiration Scans All Records
- **Summary (Optimization):** `VecStore::expire_ttl_records` iterates through every record (`src/store/mod.rs:1258`). With large stores and frequent TTL sweeps, this becomes O(n) per tick.
- **Impact:** Real-time workloads with many time-bounded inserts pay large maintenance costs, creating latency spikes.
- **Optimization Idea:** Maintain a min-heap or ordered map keyed by expiration time, allowing O(log n) removal of expired entries. Keep the full scan fallback for safety.
- **Suggested Tests/Benchmarks:** Add performance regression tests that expire thousands of records and ensure the optimized path scales sub-linearly.

### 26. `ConcurrentHashRing::add_node` Rehashes Entire Ring
- **Summary (Optimization):** Every time a node is added, the consistent hash ring rebuilds all virtual nodes (`src/distributed.rs:673`). For large clusters, this is O(n * vnodes).
- **Impact:** Dynamic scaling (auto-scaling or frequent node additions) becomes expensive, pausing request routing during rebuilds.
- **Optimization Idea:** Support incremental updates‚Äîonly add/remove the affected virtual nodes. Cache hash positions to avoid recomputing.
- **Suggested Tests/Benchmarks:** Add benchmark creating 1k nodes and measure ring update latency pre/post optimization.

### 27. `VecStore::batch_upsert` Clones Vectors Twice
- **Summary (Optimization):** Batch upsert first collects records into `Vec<Record>` and later maps into `(Id, Vec<f32>)`, cloning vectors (`src/store/mod.rs:233`). Each record clone doubles memory traffic.
- **Impact:** Large batches (MBs of embeddings) allocate and copy unnecessarily, hurting ingestion speed.
- **Optimization Idea:** Accept iterators over owned tuples or restructure to move vectors into backend without intermediate clones.
- **Suggested Tests/Benchmarks:** Extend existing perf tests to cover batch upsert throughput.

### 28. `TextIndex::tokenize` Allocations per Document
- **Summary (Optimization):** Every document indexing rebuilds hash maps and vectors, causing numerous allocations (`src/store/hybrid.rs:120`).
- **Impact:** Large document ingestion triggers repeated `HashMap` reallocation and `Vec` growth, wasting CPU.
- **Optimization Idea:** Pre-size the maps using token counts or reuse buffers (object pool) to reduce allocator churn.
- **Suggested Tests/Benchmarks:** Extend hybrid indexing benchmarks to ingest 10k docs and measure allocation count before/after.

### 29. Namespace Quota Checks Lock Twice
- **Summary (Optimization):** `NamespaceManager::upsert` acquires write locks twice‚Äîonce for quota validation and again after store mutation (`src/namespace_manager.rs:203`, `src/namespace_manager.rs:221`).
- **Impact:** High-contention workloads suffer from redundant locking; operations serialize more than necessary.
- **Optimization Idea:** Combine updates within a single write-lock scope or use RwLock read + atomic counters for fast-path checks.
- **Suggested Tests/Benchmarks:** Add concurrency benchmark issuing parallel upserts to quantify lock contention.

### 30. `prefetch_query` Repeatedly Clones Candidate Lists
- **Summary (Optimization):** Each stage in `prefetch_query` consumes and recreates candidate vectors (`src/store/mod.rs:1420`+), creating redundant allocations.
- **Impact:** Multi-stage pipelines (especially those using MMR/filter rerank) pay O(n) clone costs per stage.
- **Optimization Idea:** Pass mutable references or reuse buffers between stages to avoid cloning; consider smallvec for short candidate lists.
- **Suggested Tests/Benchmarks:** Add prefetch performance tests with 50k candidates and measure memory allocations.

### 31. `ConsistentHashRing::get_node` Uses Linear Search
- **Summary (Optimization):** Hash ring nodes are stored in Vec and searched via iteration (`src/distributed.rs:710`).
- **Impact:** Each lookup scans potentially hundreds of virtual nodes; high-QPS workloads pay unnecessary time.
- **Optimization Idea:** Maintain nodes sorted and use binary search or BTreeMap keyed by hash.
- **Suggested Tests/Benchmarks:** Add benchmark for shard lookups with 10k keys and 1k nodes to measure improvements.

### 32. Distributed Module Is Documentation-Only (Hallucinated Networking) ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Summary (Bug/Hallucination):** `DistributedStore` only tracks metadata (nodes, shards, stats) but never routes real vector operations; methods like `insert`/`query` are absent despite docs claiming full distributed indexing (`src/distributed.rs`).
- **Impact:** Users expect a functional distributed store but only receive bookkeeping structs, risking data loss if they rely on this API in production.
- **Fix Applied:** Added prominent warning to module documentation (`src/distributed/mod.rs:3-16`) clearly marking it as "EXPERIMENTAL - INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION" with detailed list of missing features (network RPC, actual replication, failure recovery, etc.). Documentation now explicitly states it's for reference architecture only.
- **Status:** Module is now correctly documented as a prototype/skeleton. Users will not be misled.

### 33. GPU Module Claims Multi-Backend Support Without Feature Flags ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Summary (Hallucination):** `GpuExecutor::create_backend` references CUDA/Metal/WebGPU, but without corresponding feature flags it returns `Err` at runtime (`src/gpu.rs:130`). Examples read as if functionality exists broadly.
- **Impact:** Developers invest time enabling GPU acceleration only to hit runtime errors.
- **Fix Applied:** Added prominent warning to module documentation (`src/gpu.rs:3-19`) clearly marking it as "EXPERIMENTAL - SKELETON IMPLEMENTATION" with status table showing CPU backend is production-ready while CUDA/Metal/WebGPU are stubs. Documentation now includes steps needed to implement actual GPU acceleration.
- **Status:** Module is now correctly documented. CPU backend is production-ready; GPU backends are clearly marked as architectural templates.

## Additional Recommended Follow-Ups

1. **Durability Contract & Documentation** ‚Äî Decide whether namespace operations should auto-flush, expose a `flush`/`commit` API, or rely on WAL/snapshot scheduling. Document the behavior prominently to avoid downstream surprises.
2. **Instrumentation Improvements** ‚Äî Consider recording metrics (e.g., number of soft-deleted vectors, compaction intervals, TTL expirations) to catch synchronization issues early.
3. **Comprehensive Regression Suite** ‚Äî Build integration tests covering multi-tenant flows (namespace create ‚Üí upsert ‚Üí save ‚Üí reload ‚Üí query) and hybrid search life cycles (index ‚Üí delete ‚Üí compact ‚Üí query). Use the new `tests/review_regressions.rs` file as a starting point.
4. **Safety Checks** ‚Äî Add debug assertions/logging whenever a text index record exists without a corresponding vector, and vice versa, to detect drift in production.
5. **HNSW Persistence Test Harness** ‚Äî Add a failing regression similar to the others once the serialization bug is addressed, ensuring future refactors keep `next_idx` consistent.
