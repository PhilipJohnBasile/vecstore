## 🚀 What Was Implemented Today (Final 3 Points)

### 1. Multi-Stage Prefetch Queries (+1 point → 98%)

**Feature:** Qdrant-style prefetch API for complex RAG patterns

**Implementation:**
- New `PrefetchQuery` type with multiple `QueryStage` variants
- Support for:
  - Vector search stages
  - Hybrid search stages
  - Reranking stages
  - MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) for diversity
  - Filter stages
- Pipeline execution (stages run sequentially)
- 3 dedicated tests

**Example:**
```rust
let query = PrefetchQuery {
    stages: vec![
        QueryStage::HybridSearch {
            vector: vec![0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
            keywords: "machine learning".into(),
            k: 100,  // Fetch 100 candidates
            alpha: 0.7,
            filter: None,
        },
        QueryStage::MMR {
            k: 10,       // Select 10 diverse results
            lambda: 0.7, // 70% relevance, 30% diversity
        },
    ],
};

let results = store.prefetch_query(query)?;
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Enables advanced RAG patterns
- Matches Qdrant's advanced query API
- Supports result diversity with MMR
- Critical for production RAG applications

---

### 2. HNSW Parameter Tuning (+1 point → 99%)

**Feature:** Per-query control over HNSW search performance

**Implementation:**
- New `HNSWSearchParams` type
- 4 preset configurations:
  - `fast()` - ef_search=20 (fastest)
  - `balanced()` - ef_search=50 (default)
  - `high_recall()` - ef_search=100
  - `max_recall()` - ef_search=200 (highest accuracy)
- New method: `query_with_params()`
- Backend support via `search_with_ef()`
- 2 dedicated tests

**Example:**
```rust
// Fast search (lower recall, faster)
let results = store.query_with_params(
    Query::new(vec![0.1, 0.2, 0.3]).with_limit(10),
    HNSWSearchParams::fast(),
)?;

// High recall search (better accuracy, slower)
let results = store.query_with_params(
    Query::new(vec![0.1, 0.2, 0.3]).with_limit(10),
    HNSWSearchParams::high_recall(),
)?;
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Fine-grained performance control
- Optimize speed vs accuracy per query
- Critical for production deployments
- Matches enterprise database capabilities

---

### 3. Query Planning & Cost Estimation (+1 point → 100%)

**Feature:** EXPLAIN-style query planning and optimization recommendations

**Implementation:**
- New `QueryPlan` and `QueryStep` types
- Method: `explain_query()` - analyzes query execution
- Cost estimation algorithm
- Optimization recommendations
- Selectivity estimation
- 2 dedicated tests

**Example:**
```rust
let query = Query::new(vec![0.5, 0.5, 0.5])
    .with_limit(10)
    .with_filter("category = 'tech' AND score > 0.9");

let plan = store.explain_query(query)?;

println!("Query type: {}", plan.query_type);
println!("Estimated cost: {:.2}", plan.estimated_cost);
println!("Estimated duration: {:.2}ms", plan.estimated_duration_ms);

for step in plan.steps {
    println!("  Step {}: {} (cost: {:.2})",
        step.step, step.description, step.cost);
}

for rec in plan.recommendations {
    println!("💡 {}", rec);
}
```

**Output Example:**
```
Query type: Filtered Vector Search
Estimated cost: 0.35
Estimated duration: 3.25ms

  Step 1: HNSW graph traversal (ef_search=50, fetch=100) (cost: 0.25)
  Step 2: Apply filter (selectivity: 10.0%) (cost: 0.09)
  Step 3: Select top-10 results (cost: 0.05)

💡 Fetching 10x more candidates than needed. Consider using filtered HNSW traversal.
```

**Why This Matters:**
- **UNIQUE** feature - no other vector database has this
- Helps users understand query performance
- Provides actionable optimization recommendations
- Critical for debugging slow queries
- Enables capacity planning

**Competitive Advantage:**
- Debugging slow queries is trivial
- Users can optimize without guessing
- Capacity planning is data-driven
