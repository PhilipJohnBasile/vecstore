# VecStore Post-1.0 Roadmap

**Current Status:** VecStore 1.0 COMPLETE ✅
**Philosophy:** Complete all features, tests, and documentation BEFORE publishing

---

## 🎯 Execution Strategy

**Feature-First Approach:**
1. Build and test ALL features completely
2. Ensure comprehensive documentation
3. Polish and refine
4. **THEN** publish to registries

This ensures we publish a truly complete, polished product rather than rushing to market.

## 🎯 Why This Approach?

### Feature-First Philosophy

**Advantages:**
1. **Quality Over Speed:** Ship a truly complete product
2. **User Trust:** First impressions matter - launch strong
3. **Reduced Churn:** Avoid publishing incomplete features
4. **Better Testing:** Time to find and fix edge cases
5. **Documentation Maturity:** Write docs while features are fresh

**Quote:** "A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad." - Applies to libraries too!

### The VecStore Promise

When we publish, users will get:
- ✅ A complete, production-ready vector database
- ✅ Full RAG toolkit with evaluation
- ✅ Multi-language support (Rust, Python, WASM)
- ✅ Advanced features (embeddings, reranking, monitoring)
- ✅ 400+ tests ensuring quality
- ✅ 28+ examples covering all use cases
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Active maintenance and support

**No "beta" labels. No "coming soon" features. Just a solid, complete product.**

## 🔄 Flexibility

This roadmap is a guide, not a contract:
- Features can be reordered based on priority
- Weeks can extend if needed for quality
- Additional features can be added
- **But:** No publication until everything is ready

**Principle:** Quality and completeness over arbitrary deadlines.
